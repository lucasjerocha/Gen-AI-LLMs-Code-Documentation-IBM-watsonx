      "How can documentation be standardized across diverse stakeholders in large-scale projects?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "Standardizing documentation across diverse stakeholders in large-scale projects requires a deep understanding of the stakeholders' perspectives, values, and concerns. By using tools like Q methodology, project managers can uncover the multidimensional nature of stakeholder positions and develop effective strategies to accommodate multiple stakeholders. This involves creating a flexible and adaptive external stakeholder management approach that can respond to changing stakeholder perspectives and values throughout the project life cycle. \n",
